## CodinHub
In today's dynamic development environment, making the workplace engaging and fun for developers is crucial for fostering creativity and productivity. To address this, the CodinHub project proposes the development of an interactive platform that interacts with pull request data from platforms like GitLab or GitHub. By analyzing this data, CodinHub will generate metrics to identify the champion of pull requests, the most active code reviewers, or even those who frequently break the pipeline.
This will be displayed on a dashboard, promoting healthy competition and a social space for shared experience within the team.
